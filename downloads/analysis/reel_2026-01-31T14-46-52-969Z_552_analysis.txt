*   **"Million dollar machines":** A colloquial way to describe expensive industrial robotics.
*   **"100X":** A brand/handle reference used as a call to action.

### **5. Overall Feedback**
**Strengths:** The speaker is excellent at using "hooks" (the GTA 6 comparison) to ground abstract technology in something the audience already cares about. Their delivery is highly structured, moving logically from what the tech *is* to how it *works* to why it *matters*.
**Areas for Improvement:** The delivery can feel slightly "formulaic" for social media; adding a brief personal take or a moment of genuine "unscripted" reaction could further increase the authenticity and connection with the audience.
